# ¿What are piRNAs?
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are single-stranded small non-coding RNAs initially discovered in germ cells with a role as defenders of genomic integrity in the germline, acting as post-transcriptional repressors of transposable elements. With a regular range around 27 nucleotides, piRNAs are associated with the PIWI clade of Argonaute family proteins (in the mouse MIWI, MILI or MIWI2). Processed piRNAs preferentially accommodate uridine residues at 5’-end and 2'-O-methylated 3'-end to increase stability of these molecules. piRNAs have also been detected in somatic cells with diverse potential functions indicating its high plasticity and pleiotropic activity.


# Database 

This is a mouse piRNA sequence database where piRNAs idnetification criteria is exclusively the habitlity to boud any of mouse PIWI proteins.

The idea was originaly apply by Larriba et All [1]
